\title{Form sample matrix from GDC low-pass segmentation datafiles.}
\usage{
formSampleMatrixFromRawGDCData(tcga_files = NULL, format = "TARGET",
  binsize = 1e+06, freadskip = 14)
}
\arguments{
\item{format}{file format, TCGA or TARGET.}

\item{binsize}{the binsize, in base pairs (default 1Mb or 1e6).  This value provides a good balance of resolution and speed with memory sensitive applications.}

\item{file}{GDC file to be read}

\item{freadksip}{the number of lines to skip in the GDC files, typically 14 (the first 13 lines are metadata and the first is a blank line in NBL data). Adjust as needed.}
}
\value{
sample_aggregated_segvals A dataframe containing the aggregated segmentation values, based on the parameters provided.
}
\description{
Reads a GDC segmetnation files, adds sample information, and forms a data matrix of samples and bins of a specified size.
