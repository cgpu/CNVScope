\title{Rescale positive and negative data, preserving sign information.}
\usage{
downsample_genomic_matrix(whole_matrix, downsamplefactor,
  singlechromosome = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{whole_matrix}{A matrix to be downsampled, on a single chromosome}

\item{downsamplefactor}{A factor by which to reduce the matrix. Must be something that both the row and columns can be divisible by.}

\item{singlechromosome}{Single chromosome mode; Multi-chromosome not yet implemented (leave T)}
}
\value{
whole_matrix_dsamp A downsampled matrix.
}
\description{
Performs a signed rescale on the data, shrinking the negative and positive ranges into the [0,1] space, such that negative is always less than 0.5 and positive is always greater.
